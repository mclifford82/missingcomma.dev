### I can't believe blogs are a thing again

Oh, hey there. I didn't see you. _&lt;chuckles heartily&gt;_

The last time I had a blog, I think I wrote it myself in PHP then eventually migrated over to Wordpress. Now I'm using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>, which is pretty neat. Low maintenance. Just add a markdown file with some metadata and words and you have yourself a post.

Getting it setup with Github pages wasn't too hard. I just had to do a bunch of DNS updates so that this thing linked to that thing and magic happened.

This post may be dated April 20th, but make no mistake, it has taken me over a week to actually fill up that little markdown file with some words. My ADHD has run amok because I haven't taken my Wellbutrin in a couple days. I should probably go do that before I forget.

Anyway, I set up this blog up to muse about my ideas, discuss lessons learned in recovery, talk about coding stuff, share cat photos, and even share some of my better Mario kaizo clears for your entertainment. The plan is to make my next few posts cover these topics broadly. I was going to put it all in this one, but I'd rather actually publish _something_ to get this blog schmovin'.

Okay, well that is my first post. Phew. We got that out of the way!
